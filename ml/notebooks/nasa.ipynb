    "# Overview\n",
    "This notebook intends to create a model that can be used to predict the concentration of microplastics, given the latitude, longitude and timestamp. For this your group will create 3 different models:\n",
    " - model 1: To predict the horizontal velocity(u) vector od the given latitude and longitude\n",
    " - model 2: To predict the vertical velocity(v) vector of the given latitude and longitude\n",
    " - model 3: To predict the concentration of microplastics of the given latitude, longitude, u, v and timestamp\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Explanation\n",
    "The data using in this notebook was obtained from the [EARTHDATA](https://gpm.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/).\n",
    "And all data was provide in the form of a netCDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ocean Currents\n",
    "This dataset describes the ocean currents at the surface of the Earth, between 01/01/1993 and 01/01/2021.\n",
